            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Sagar Giradkar</span> from <span className="purple">Pune, India</span>.
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at PVG's College of Engineering and Technology under Savitribai Phule Pune University.
            <br />
            I have completed internships in full-stack and mobile development roles at companies like Argyle Enigma Tech Labs, Real List AI Technologies, and Smile Computer Education.
            <br />
            I'm passionate about developing innovative, real-world solutions and have hands-on experience in frontend, backend, and AI-powered systems.
            <br />
            Iâ€™ve worked on projects such as a smart robotic system using computer vision and an e-learning platform, and contributed to a Scopus-indexed research paper in AI and robotics.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
